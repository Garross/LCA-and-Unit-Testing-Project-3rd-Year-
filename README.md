# LCA-and-Unit-Testing-Project-3rd-Year
A program solution to the Lowest Common Ancestor Problem, together with extensive unit testing. This is Development Task 1 for the 3rd Year MSISS Software Engineering Module 2019. The program must be able to find the LCA of a binary tree.

_Tasks_:
Classic Coding: Establish a binary tree.
Reuse-Orientated Development: Find suitable code for finding the LCA in Binary Tree online.
Quality Analysis: Prepare extensive unit testing to check which solution works best.
Software Engineering GIT: Use copious amounts of branching and history recording for higher work efficiency and incase of a change in work requirements.

_Official Assignment Objectives_:

Choose a unit testing framework. A comprehensive by language list is available here.

Create a repository on a git service such as Github. Your work will be implemented in this repository.

Define a set of initial unit tests that capture the basic expected behaviour. This will require you to create sample data and also to identify the basic API(Application Programming Interface) for your solution.

Build your initial solution, testing it against your test code until it is working.

Refine the solution, expanding your test cases to deal with awkward parameters and edge cases that push the limits of your solution, enhancing your solution to deal with these.

_Suggested Approach_:

 I suggest you begin by writing the initial test code, commit, and then solve each failing test case, commiting on each success. You might thus perform a series of commits over a development session. Do this, remembering that the creation of a commit point does not necessitate the pushing of the commit to the online repository at that moment in time. Note also that the repository submission date is entirely unrelated to our grading model. All commits to online repository systems are dated, and these are the dates we go by.
